## Third Scene

### On the terrain of the Beryllium Mansion

*(The camera follows the party busses through the terrain near the beryllium mansion. It focuses on one party bus and zooms in on it.
It shows the inside of the party bus. You see particles partying, music playing, confetti, etc.
The first scene will be a conversation between three particles (maybe three quarks forming one baryon ?), on the party bus. )*

**Particle A**: 
Honey, I'm so excited to attend the annual Baryon Ball at the beryllium mansion. The whole neighbourhood talks about it. It is the event of the year!

**Particle B**: 
Yeah, I know. I couldn't get a break from this topic at work. To be honest, I think all this excitement is quite exhausting, I hate parties and I hate dancing...the food is always quite good though!

**Particle C**:
Oh, come on! We are going to have a great time. And the best thing this place will be free from the mesons, those rowdies. I could need a day without news about the CP-violation, electron-positron annihilation and all the other nonsense, they're doing day in and day out.

*(The camera zooms out of the party bus. It follows the bus with the mansion showing in the background. 
There is a cut to the next scene with the Jpsi and The D-meson. Both are acting suspiciously.)*

### Infront of the Beryllium Mansion

**J/&psi;**: Hey, I have an idea. They seriously think they just don't invite us and have their fancy little anti meson party. No, way hahaha.
Come help me out here, the busses will try to pass the gate any minute!

*(As the buses come closer, Jpsi secretly removes a few bricks from the gate to the Beryllium mansion, so that the party buses will no longer fit through the gate.)*

**D-meson**: Haha, that is hilarious let me help you out. I love pranking the baryons!
Let's ruin the party!

**J/&psi;**: and D-meson rush away to hide in the bushes.

*(The camera swings away from the bushes and shows the approaching busses from the side with the gate on the left. The busses crash into the gate.
There is a cut to the Jpsi and D-meson. Both are laughing, while there escaping from the 'crime scene'.
The angry and confused baryons pour out from the busses, onto the street. There's chaos. )*
