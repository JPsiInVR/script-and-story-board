## Second Scene





The viewer enters a door to a physicist's office at SLAC (Stanford Linear Accelerator Center). You hear chattering of his colleagues and telephone calls/a telephone ringing. 
The camera focuses on a physicists desk.
There's a physicist bend over several documents titled "SPEAR Accelerator", "MARK I & II Detectors", ..

**Physicist:** Welcome to the Stanford Linear Accelerator Centre!. Here, we study particle physics by conducting different experiments. Let me explain to you how we are looking for new particles at this place.

### Section 1: How does a particle physics experiment look?

Our experiment takes place at the SPEAR accelerator at SLAC. As the name suggests SLAC is a research facility, that provides a linear particle accelerator (LINAC). That means particles that are given into the LINAC are accelerated along with a linear distance, meaning they get faster and faster until a maximum velocity is reached. The LINAC is a practical tool to accelerate particles, but it quickly reaches the technological limits in possible acceleration. If you want to reach even higher velocities you have to work with a particle storage ring or a particle collider. Here the particles are entered into a ring and they can pass through the accelerator several times while gaining velocity and energy with every turn.

### Section 2: What is a particle detector?

Now you know how our experiments is set up. However, in the previous section, you have also learned that it is impossible to see the created particles with a bare eye since they are so tiny. Furthermore, many of the particles we can create at SLAC have very short lifetimes. This is a very common challenge in particle physics. Imagine you are looking for a specific particle that is created in the reaction. Technically this particle already decays after a few nanoseconds. That means its lifetime is very short. Now there are mainly two options you have left. Either you can see/detect the particle in such a short amount of time. This is however nearly impossible due to technological restrictions. It is just too little time to separate all of the particles and find the single one you want to look at in more detail.

The second and to scientists preferred possibility is to identify the particle you are searching for based on its decay product. This can also be quite a challenge but the timescales you are working within that case are far more feasible.

Let’s have a look at an example.
Say you are searching for a pion. It is a meson that consists of 2. It has a lifetime of ...ns and decays mainly into 2 photons.

So now the goal would be to be able to detect these two photons and recursively combine them to a pion. While detecting the photons it is not just important to know that they were there, but also how much energy they had. With this information, it is possible to reconstruct the energy of the pion we are looking for.

Know you probably ask yourself how we find out all of this information about the photons: that's the job of particle detectors.

You can think of detectors as huge devices that by the interaction of their matter with particles can detect these?
They usually consist of several layers of different materials to detect different kinds of particles.

Let’s have a look at how our detector looks:
