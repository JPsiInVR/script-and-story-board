## Second Scene




_The viewer enters a door to a physicist's office at SLAC (Stanford Linear Accelerator Center). You hear the chattering of his colleagues and telephone calls/a telephone ringing. 
The camera focuses on a physicists desk.
There's a physicist bend over two documents titled "SPEAR Accelerator" and "MARK I Detectors"_

**Physicist:** Welcome to the Stanford Linear Accelerator Centre! Here, we study particle physics by conducting different experiments. Let me explain to you how we are looking for new particles at this place.


_The viewer can select a document (section) that starts an explanation of the basic components of the particle physics experiment at SLAC._


### Section 1: SPEAR Particle Accelerator

**Physicist:** Our experiment takes place at the SPEAR accelerator at SLAC. As the name suggests SLAC is a research facility, that provides a linear particle accelerator (LINAC). That means particles that are given into the LINAC are accelerated along a linear track. In this way, they get faster and faster until a maximum velocity is reached. The LINAC is a practical tool to accelerate particles, but it quickly reaches its technological limits in possible acceleration, because of the limited distance the particles can travel before leaving the accelerator. 

If you want to reach even higher velocities you have to work with a particle storage ring, also called a particle collider. Here, the particles are entered into a ring and they can pass through the accelerator track several times while gaining velocity and energy with every turn. This is the kind of accelerator that SPEAR represents at SLAC. It stands for Stanford Positron Electron Asymmetric Ring. Judging by the name you can already guess that it was used to accelerate and eventually collide electrons and positrons. However, the asymmetry part is just a historic reference and we can neglect it for now. 

So to recap, at SLAC, we have a particle collider in which electrons are being accelerated in one direction of the ring and the positrons are accelerated in the other direction in form of particle beams. Whilst being accelerated electrons and positions are separated from each other until they reach a certain velocity and energy. At this energy, the two particle beams are brought together at the so-called interactions points. 
But what exactly happens when you collide electrons and positrons? Well, if you collide a particle with its antiparticle they annihilate. That means, both particles disappear and mass and velocity are translated into energy. This released energy is the starting point for the production of new particles. 

And this is the whole point of having particle accelerators. We shoot particles onto each other in the hope to create different and maybe even new, and yet undiscovered particles. But to examine what kind of particles are created we have to look closely at the interaction point. 
SPEAR offers two such points along its circumference. Each of these points is used for a different experiment and offers different particle detectors to observe what happens after the beam collision.


### Section 2: MARK I Particle Detector

**Physicist:** Now you know how our experiment is set up. However, in the previous section, you have also learned that it is impossible to see the created particles with a bare eye since they are so tiny. Furthermore, many of the particles we can create at SLAC have very short lifetimes. This is a very common challenge in particle physics. Imagine you are looking for a specific particle that is created in the beam collision. Technically, this particle already decays after a few nanoseconds. That means its lifetime is very short. Now there are mainly two options you have left. Either you can see/detect the particle in such a short amount of time. This is however nearly impossible due to technological restrictions. It is just too little time to separate all of the particles and find the single one you want to look at in more detail.

The second and to scientists preferred possibility is to identify the particle you are searching for based on its decay products. This can also be quite a challenge but the timescales you are working with in that case are far more feasible.

Let’s have a look at an example.
Say you are searching for a pion. It is a meson that consists of 2 quarks. It has a lifetime of approximately 0.0001 ps and decays mainly into 2 photons.

So now the goal would be to be able to detect these two photons and recursively combine them to a pion. While detecting the photons it is not just important to know that they were there, but also how much energy they had. With this information, it is possible to reconstruct the energy of the pion we are looking for.

Now you probably ask yourself how we find out all of this information about the photons: Well, that's the job of our particle detectors.

You can think of detectors as huge devices that by the interaction of their matter with particles can figure out their properties.
They usually consist of several layers of different materials to detect different kinds of particles.

Let’s have a look at one of our particle detectors at the SPEAR accelerator: The MARK I detector.
