## First Scene

### Inside PNN newsroom

*(News intro: "This is PNN Breaking News")*

**News Particle**: The series of electron and positron thefts at the central lepton storage room seems to continue. In a recently released statement, the Baryon family reached out to the thief. Within that statement, the family begs the thief to stop removing the leptons, as the youngest members of the Baryon family, Penelope Proton and Norman Neutron, are in desperate need of electrons to build their atoms.

### Inside the lepton storage room

*(positron and electron annihilate, flash, particle appears out of nowhere; particle looks around cautiously)*

**J/&psi;:** All right, seems like the coast is clear.

*(particle turns to the viewer)*

**J/&psi;:** Hi, hi you! I'm on the run, so we have to keep it quiet, okay? I would like to introduce myself to you: My name is J/&psi; and I'm a particle. 
What! You never heard of me? Well, I don't even know where to start in that case.
Let's talk about the particle part again. You must think of a particle as a tiny amount of matter. However not in the sense of for example a particle of dust, but even smaller. And there is a ton of us! You maybe already heard of Penelope Proton and the Norman Neutron. 

*(proton and neutron appear on screen)*

In fact, all the matter that surrounds you, every atom is made up of protons, neutrons and electrons. I'm sure you've already heard of the hydrogen atom, right? It consists of one proton and one electron! You see, you do know something about particles. 

**J/&psi;:** Now you might think: "They make up all the matter that surrounds me? But I can't see any particles!"
 Well, that is because they are so tiny that you can't possibly see them with bare eye. They are even smaller than dust particles. And on top of that, if you take the proton and the neutron, they consist of even smaller constituents which are referred to as quarks. 

*(quarks appear on screen)*

**J/&psi;:** To be more specific, the quarks that make up the proton and neutron are called up- and down-quarks. On the other hand, the electron that appears in an atom is part of a group called leptons. Quarks and leptons occur in three different generations. For quarks in each generation, there are two different flavours. For example the up- and down-flavoured quarks in the first generation.

*(highlight up and down quark)*


**J/&psi;:** These are the quarks Penelope and Norman are made up of. I am also built by quarks, but they belong to the second generation and are called charm quarks...

*(highlight charm and strange quarks)*

**J/&psi;:** There are also top and bottom quarks and the quark mass increases with every generation. It is similar in the case of the leptons. The electron has two other relatives, that are exact copies in most of its characteristics, but with increasing mass. So the third generation lepton is heavier than the second generation lepton that is heavier than the first generation lepton. This mass hierarchy however is not apparent in the three other leptons, called neutrinos. They seem to be massless and practically invisible. The quarks and leptons are elementary particles, that means we can build a ton of other particles with them, like the proton and neutron and me! 
In comparison to Penelope and Norman, I only consist of two of those charm quarks, not three. *->EDIT NOTE: More info needed: Start by talking about proton and neutron and their exact quark content and then move on the J/Psi. Afterwards, generalize to all mesons and baryons.*
This is common to all members of the Meson family. All particles that consist of three quarks however are called baryons. And do you know how many baryons and mesons there are? A lot, in fact, there are so many that a whole zoo of particles exist!

*(some kind of zoo illustration with particles :D )*

**J/&psi;:** "But how do we know", you ask yourself? "How we know that there exist particles when we can't even see those particles?"
Well, there are ways to make them visible. Take this bubble chamber for example. 

*(some kind of bubble chamber illustration)*

You can see several tracks here. Some of them are curved, some are straight. Every single track belongs to a particle. Some of the tracks are produced by mesons, that travel through the liquid in this chamber. Some are created by electrons and so on. This is one of the most basic ways to make some particles visible. But you will learn more about that on the course of our adventure. 

Before we start there is still one thing I have to tell you about my world. 
My family, the meson family is very humble and down to earth. Unlike the Baryons who, just because they have one quark more are very arrogant and bigheaded. I cannot stand them at all! 
And I can assure you this feeling is mutual. The Baryons condemn us for getting in trouble too often and being some sort of criminals since my strange cousin Kaon was arrested for CP-violation.

### Inside PNN newsroom

**News Particle**: Good evening ladies and gentleman. Welcome to our Breaking news special, where we keep you up to date about everything important that is happening in these turbulent times.
We were informed that, right now, the particle police is arresting the Kaon. It is being accused of direct CP-violation and there is strong evidence, that the Kaon is one of the particles responsible for this criminal act.


### Inside lepton storage room
**J/&psi;:** Listen I know, this sounds bad, but whatever the baryons tell you about us, don't -

*(Door to lepton storage room clicks, the particle is alarmed and vanishes in a flash of light)*
