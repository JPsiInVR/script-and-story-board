## First Scene

### Part 1: Inside PNN newsroom

*(News intro: "This is PNN Breaking News", Bubble Chamber animation in the background, breaking news lettering floats in)*

**News Particle**: The series of electron and positron thefts at the central lepton storage room seems to continue. In a recently released statement, the Baryon family reached out to the thief. Within that statement, the family begs the thief to stop removing the leptons, as the youngest members of the Baryon family, Penelope Proton and Norman Neutron, are in desperate need of electrons to build their atoms.

## Second Scene

### Part 2: Inside the lepton storage room

#### Section 1: Menu lobby 

*(positron and electron annihilate, flash, particle appears out of nowhere; particle looks around cautiously)*

**J/&psi;:** All right, seems like the coast is clear.

*(particle turns to the viewer)*

**J/&psi;:** Hi, hi you! I'm on the run, so we have to keep it quiet, okay? I would like to introduce myself to you: My name is J/&psi; and I'm a particle. 
What! You never heard of me? Well, I don't even know where to start in that case. 
Let me give you a short explanation of how my world works. 

If you want to select an item in the particle world simply direct you view at it. It will start pulsating and the selected action will be carried out. To exit the VR-Adventure, keep an eye on our exit particle. It will accompany you throughout this experience. 

Now if you are wondering what a particle is, and what this adventure is all about, then click right here.

*(The next sections provide short explanations of one aspect of the particle world and will be individually accessible for the viewer.)*

#### Section 2: Particles

Hello again! Let's learn about elementary particles, together!
You must think of a particle as a tiny amount of matter. However not in the sense of for example a particle of dust, but even smaller. 
Do you find this hard to imagine? Well, let's have a closer look. 

*(show a zoom-in of daily life, small matter (dust particle, hair, etc. into the atomic scale. Zoom stops at the atomic nucleus.)*

You are certainly familiar with the matter that surrounds us. That includes ourselves, as well as everyday objects like a table or cup of coffee. All of these consists of small building blocks, we call them molecules. When you combine several molecules you can build massive objects as well as liquids and of course gas. But these molecules are not the smallest part of matter that surrounds us. Because molecules themselves are built by atoms. To form a molecule you can bind together different atoms. Here you see the caffeine molecule, which is built from 4 different kinds of atoms. The term atom originates in the Greek word Ã¡tomos which can be translated to indivisible. Implying that atoms would be the smallest and therefore elementary particles that all matter consists of. But today we know that this is not true. 
Atoms themselves are not elementary. They consist of a nucleus that builds the core of the atom. This nucleus itself is surrounded by electrons. For the sake of simplicity, you can imagine that electrons orbit the nucleus just like, planets orbit the sun. 
In reality, however, it's far more complicated. It's impossible to follow the trajectory of the electron and to know exactly when it will be where. To describe this uncertainty one can only specify a probability of where the electron could be. There are positions in space where the probability is higher to find an electron and positions where the probability is very low and it would be very unlikely to find an electron.
The electron by the way is indeed indivisible and hence is referred to as an elementary particle. But what about the nucleus? Is it elementary, too? 

Well, as you might have guessed, it's not! The nucleus again is built from smaller particles: the nucleons. And we know that two different types of nucleons exist: You maybe already heard of Penelope the Proton and the Norman the Neutron.
(proton and neutron appear on screen)
But if we want to learn more about the truly elementary particles, we have to take a closer look at the proton and the neutron again. To find out what these two are made of, check out the next section. 


#### Section 3: Quarks

**J/&psi;:** Now you might think: "These particles are supposed to make up all the matter that surrounds me? But I can't see any particles!"
 Well, that is because they are so tiny that you can't possibly see them. They are even smaller than dust particles. And on top of that, if you take the proton and the neutron, they consist of even smaller constituents which are referred to as quarks. 

*(quarks appear on screen)*

**J/&psi;:** To be more specific, the quarks that make up the proton and neutron are called up- and down-quarks. 
Let's have the Up-quark explain this to us in more detail.

*(up-quark joins J/&psi;:, starts explaining )*

**Up-Quark:** Hi everybody, I am an Up-Quark. Us Quarks occur in three different generations. For quarks in each generation, there are two different flavours. In my generation for example, there are quarks like me, that are up-flavoured, as well as quarks that are down-flavoured.

*(highlight down quark)*

**J/&psi;:** Yes, these two are the quarks Penelope and Norman are made up of. Thanks for helping me out 'Up'!
I am also built by quarks, but they belong to the second generation of quarks. Carry on to the next section, to learn about all the other quarks that exist!

#### Section 4 Higher generation Quarks and Leptons

So, let's have a look at the second generation of quarks. It consists of the quarks I am built of, the charm quarks. The other flavour of the second generation is referred to as strange-quark. 

*(highlight charm and strange quarks)*

**J/&psi;:** There are also top and bottom quarks and the quark mass increases with every generation. It is similar in the case of a second particle family, the leptons. One of its members you already know: the electron. The electron has two other relatives, that are exact copies in most of its characteristics, but with increasing mass. So the third generation lepton is heavier than the second generation lepton that is heavier than the first generation lepton. This mass hierarchy however is not apparent in the three other leptons, called neutrinos. They seem to be massless and practically undetectable. The quarks and leptons are elementary particles, which means we can build a ton of other particles with them, like the proton and neutron and even me! Let's have a closer look at that in the next section!

#### Section 5 Mesons and Baryons

*(some kind of zoom-in/animation inside the proton and neutron ?)*

You now know that proton and neutron are built by up- and down-quarks. And their quark content also serves as a way to differentiate between those two particles. The proton has two up-quarks and one down-quark. For the neutron, it's just the other way around. It consists of two down-quarks and one up-quark. The different quark content of the nucleons also influences their electric charge. Because of the majority of positively charged up-quarks, the proton has a positive charge. Since there are more negatively charged down-quarks inside the neutron it has a resulting negative charge. That's another way to distinguish between proton and neutron! 
So, now you understand how Penelope and Norman are formed.
In comparison to Penelope and Norman, I only consist of two quarks, namely the charm quarks.
This is common to all members of my family, the Meson family. Here every particle consists of two quarks, while in the Baryon family all members are made up of three quarks. And do you know how many baryons and mesons there are? A lot, in fact, there are so many that a whole zoo of particles exist!

*(some kind of zoo illustration with particles :D )*

#### Section 6 Particle Detection

**J/&psi;:** "But how do we know", you ask yourself? "How we know that there exist particles when we can't even see those particles?"
Well, there are ways to prove that they are around. Take this bubble chamber for example. 

*(some kind of bubble chamber illustration)*

You can see several tracks here. Some of them are curved, some are straight. Every single track belongs to a particle. 
As an incoming particle reacts with the liquid, tracks of the particles become visible as trails of (tiny) bubbles, which can be photographed.
Some of the tracks are produced by mesons, that travel through the liquid in this chamber. 
Some are created by electrons and so on. This is one of the most basic ways to make some particles detectable. But you will learn more about that on the course of our adventure. 

Before we start there is still one thing I have to tell you about my world. 
My family, the meson family is very humble and down to earth. Unlike the Baryons who, just because they have one quark more are very arrogant and bigheaded. I cannot stand them at all! 
And I can assure you this feeling is mutual. The Baryons condemn us for getting in trouble too often and being some sort of criminals since my strange cousin Kaon was arrested for CP-violation. 

*(flashback of Kaon arrest by __PNN__ (Particle News Network))*

### Part 3: Inside PNN newsroom

**News Particle**: Good evening ladies and gentleman. Welcome to our Breaking news special, where we keep you up to date about everything important that is happening in these turbulent times.
We were informed that, right now, the particle police is arresting the Kaon. It is being accused of direct CP-violation and there is strong evidence, that the Kaon is one of the particles responsible for this criminal act.


### Part 4: Inside lepton storage room

**J/&psi;:** Listen I know, this sounds bad, but whatever the baryons tell you about us, don't -

*(Door to lepton storage room clicks, the particle is alarmed and vanishes in a flash of light)*
