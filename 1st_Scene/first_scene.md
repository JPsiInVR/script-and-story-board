## First Scene

### Inside PNN news room

*(News intro: "This is PNN Breaking News")*

**Particle**: The series of electron and positron thefts at the central lepton storage room seems to continue. In a recently released statment, the Baryon family reached out to the thief. The statement emphasizes again that the youngest members of the Baryon family, Penelope Proton and Norman Neutron, are in desparate need for electrons to build their atoms.

### Inside the lepton storage room

*(positron and electron annihilate, flash, particle appears out of nowhere; particle looks around cautiously)*

**J/&psi;:** All right, seems like the coast is clear.

*(particle turns to the viewer)*

**J/&psi;:** Hi, hi you! I'm on the run, so we have to keep it quiet, okay? I would like to introduce myself: My name is J/&psi; and I'm a particle.
What! You never heard of me? Well, I don't even know where to start in that case.
Let's talk about the particle part again. You must think of a particle as a tiny amount of matter. However not in the sense of for example a particle of dust, but even smaller. And there is a ton of us! You maybe already heard of Penelope Proton and the Norman Neutron.

*(proton and neutron appear on screen)*

**J/&psi;:** They make up all the matter that surrounds you, but they are so tiny that you can barely see them. And, unbelievably, they consist of even smaller constituents which are the quarks. 

*(quarks appear on screen)*

**J/&psi;:** There are three generations of quarks. The lightest one is the first generation with the up and down quark.

*(highlight up and down quark)*

**J/&psi;:** These are the quarks Penelope and Norman are made up of. I am also built by quarks, but they belong to the second generation and are called charm quarks...

*(highlight charm and strange quarks)*

**J/&psi;:** ...and a bit heavier than those of the first generation. Besides, in comparison to Penelope and Norman, I only consist of two of those charm quarks, not three.
This is common to all members of the Meson family. My family is very humble and down to earth, by the way. Unlike the Baryons who, just because they have one quark more are very arrogant and bigheaded. I cannot stand them at all! 
And I can assure you this feeling is mutual. The Baryons condemn us for getting in trouble too often and being some sort of criminals since my strange cousin Kaon was arrested for CP-violation.

### Inside PNN news room
**Particle**: Good evening ladies and gentleman. Welcome to our Breaking news special, where we keep you up to date about everything important that is happening in these turbulent times.
We were informed that, right now, the particle police is arresting the Kaon. It is being accused of direct CP-violation and there is strong evidence, that the Kaon is one of the particles responsible for this criminal act.
