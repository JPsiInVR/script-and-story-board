# Story line

## Historical context
* The story takes place in the year 1974, where the J/&psi; particle was discovered as part of the November revolution in particle physics. Hence the story line in the particle world picks up the revolution theme, in the sense of an overthrow of a social order, in favour of a new system. Here, the Mesons act as the revolutionaries from the middle class. They want to challenge the Baryons, which are part of the bourgeois (similar to the french revolution, but less violent). 

## Scene 1 - J/&psi; introduces itself
* breaking news: theft of electrons ans positrons has been reported; "unknown particle is stealing innocent electrons and positrons from central lepton storage"
* lepton storage room: 
    * electron and positron lifted from shelves by invisible particle
    * electron and positron brought close together: merge in flash of light
    * J/&psi; appears and presents itself to viewer
    * introduction quarks: three generations (young and slim, middle and normal, old and chubby)
    * introduction mesons and baryons: rivaling families, conflicts between families and with police
    * introduction: proton, neutron are baryons
    * introduction: Kaon is strange cousin
   
* flashback - breaking news: Kaon arrested for CP-violation
* lepton storage room: J/&psi; disappears in flash of light

## Scene 2 - SPEAR
* point of view physicist: desk with papers on detector and accelerator at Stanford
* focus on detector paper: change of scene to detector
    * structure of detector explained
    * readout explained
    * trigger explained
* focus on accelerator paper: change of scene to accelerator
    * electrons and positrons accelerated
    * annihilation of particle/antiparticle
    * formation of new particles
* telephone call from BNL: "We've got a hint"


## Scene 3 - Beryllium mansion
* beryllium mansion: huge house in the hills owned by the Baryons, single street leads up to gate
    * anti-meson party at beryllium mansion, many protons and neutrons already there
    * several (3-4) party buses filled with cheering protons are driving to the mansion and the arriving protons plan to join the party
    * since mesons are excluded from the party, J/&psi; wants to prank the baryons: as the buses come closer, he secretly removes a few bricks from the gate to the Beryllium mansion, so that the party buses no longer fit through the gate
    * the first bus gets stuck in the gate and the subsequent buses clash into the first one
    * protons are angry and confused 
    * within all the chaos some protons are able to identify the escaping J/&psi; as the offender
* breaking news: J/&psi; now wanted for theft of electrons and positrons and because of sabotage/causing a massive clash at beryllium mansion
